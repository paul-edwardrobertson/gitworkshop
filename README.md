# 1. The Basics

A basic git operation has three stages.
    1. git add
        At this stage you select which files you would like to upload.

    2. git commit
        At this stage, you confirm the files you have selected and add a message to say what the purpose of the commit is

    3. git push
        This is where the selected files are uploaded to the website.
